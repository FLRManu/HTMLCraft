HTMLCraft is a project only made with ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini, based on popular game Minecraft.

HTMLCraft is a 2D browser game only made with JavaScript, CSS and HTML, where you can use multiple blocks to make structures in-game

The game is still on construction, where the only blocks available are:
Grass block

Stone

The controls are simple, you use W or up arrow key to jump, the directional right and left keys or A and D to move left and right, E to toggle the inventory, right click to place blocks, and left click to delete blocks.
